# Project4 - Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

This project is about learning how to incorporate Webpack and its dependencies into a development workflow. It also demonstrates the idea of separation of concerns: for example, Javascript files are separated in client and server side folders. 

The concept of the project is to call MeaningCloud's Sentiment Analysis API, which analyzes a news article or blog's opinions, facts, irony, agreement/disagreement, and polarity. The user inputs a link of an article/blog in the field provided. If the input is not a URL, the form results show that it is missing. If the user inputs a link of a true news article or blog page, the form results show on the page with data for agreement, score tag, irony, model, etc.
